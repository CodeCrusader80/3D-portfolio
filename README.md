<h1>Three Portfolio</h1>

<p>This project aims to have me create a portfolio using the power of React and ThreeJS to obtain a correct rendering in the display of 3D components on a real website
</p>
<p>To carry out this project I rely on the Javascript Mastery tutorial on YouTube which offers this free of charge to the community. It's a good way for me to start seriously experimenting in the field of 3D and therefore what is being done more and more on the web.</p>
